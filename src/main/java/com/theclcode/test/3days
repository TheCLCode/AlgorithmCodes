I still remember it clearly. It happens in three days. Sa loob pa ng tatlong araw! Pero naaalala ko. Alam ko ang mangyayari.
Jesus, I can't believe it actually happened, that it will be me. I mean, I don't hate what happened -- or what will happen -- but still?

It was a Friday night, April 24. People who live in Metro Manila know what kind of hell it is during a Friday night rush hour.
It was also raining heavily. I was riding this UV trying to get to Ayala, contemplating about work. Iniisip ko kung
paano pa ako mas magiging magaling, mas respetado. Pero sa totoo lang, kahit makuha ko lahat ng gusto ko, hindi naman
sapat 'yun para maging masaya ang puso ko. I'm starting to think that what I do for a living is pointless.

Anyway, dahil nga Biyernes nang gabi, lahat nagmamadali to the point na ang mga dapat ligtas, nagiging delikado. We were
already on the road for about an hour, and we were about to cross EDSA, when the driver decided to rush rather than live.
He tried to beat the red light to cross EDSA towards Ayala.
And boom, the end. We got hit by a bus. I don't know how many of us died, or if I was the only one. All I knew
is that I didn't feel any pain. I just suddenly felt cold. And death came to me.

And then I woke. My phone alarm was ringing. Nagunat ako at umupo sa higaan ko. Hinayaan ko munang mag ingay ang alarm ko.
Ramdam kong basa ang likod ko. Malamig dahil sa aircon, pero pawis ako.
